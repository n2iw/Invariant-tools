This is a tool set for running Daikon and processing invariant data sets. Most of the tools were written in Python and some in Bash. 

The tool set was used to prepare data for ["Effective Online Software Anomaly Detection" ISSTA 2017](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N31089&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BwOMVB5k4Sl2ngg%2B1S5p1FA%3D%3D)
